# 📺 AI Voice-Controlled Remote

A smart, Streamlit-based voice-controlled remote interface that listens to your voice commands and matches them to Indian TV channels. Designed to be low-latency, easily extendable, and user-friendly — perfect for integration with hardware-based remote control systems.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **User clicks "🎤 Record Voice Command"**
2. The app records audio via microphone using `speech_recognition`
3. Transcribed text is matched to the catalogue or alias list using fuzzy matching
4. If a valid match is found, the app displays the corresponding channel
5. If the command is unclear, the app shows a helpful error message

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-remote-streamlit.git
cd ai-remote-streamlit
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> If `requirements.txt` is missing, here’s what you need:
```bash
pip install streamlit pandas speechrecognition rapidfuzz
```

---

## ▶️ Running the App

```bash
streamlit run ai_remote_gui.py
```

> Make sure your microphone is enabled and accessible by the app.

## ✏️ Editing Aliases

You can create aliases like:

- `starvijay → Star Vijay`
- `sunnext → Sun TV`
- `ndtv → NDTV India`

All aliases must map to a valid channel in the catalogue. The UI will help validate this mapping.
